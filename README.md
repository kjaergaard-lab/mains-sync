# Zero Crossing Detector

  This device generates a square wave output: the polarity of the
  mains input. This means that the edges of the output correspond to
  zero-crossings of the mains cycle.

## Purpose

   This device is used to synchronize an experiment with the mains
   cycle, to ensure that the mains noise is consistent between runs

## Construction

   There is no PCB layout for this device, as it is constructed on
   veroboard/stripboard. This schematic exists purely for future
   reference.
